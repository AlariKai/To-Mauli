                        &emsp; We've been together for roughly six months now since we started dating ofcourse, Since this is the first time i celebrate Valentine's Day I think this is the perfect time to say it—you’re the reason why my life feels colorful. It was that smile, the first time i saw it, i knew i wanted to see it for the rest of my life. 
                    </span>
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp;  Ive been thinking about sunsets lately..you know...how  its so beautiful yet stil fades away every evening? Until i realized that ive been thinking wrong all this time...About sunsets. They don't just fade. They make room for the stars. And you? You'd be the brightest star amongst them all, because no one could ever make me yearn for a star more than i have..for you. My sweet little peaches, as much as your kink for saying sorry works. Let me apologize for making you anxious about not figuring out the date. You were a surprise gift to me. Let me surprise you this time. My Love, Will you be my Valentine? I just wanted you to know how special you are to me, regardless of your answer. In unexpected ways, you have warmed my heart, and I am thankful for that. But if you say yes, I swear to show you how much I value you, to make you smile, to cherish you, and to make every day feel like Valentine's Day.
